    "\n",
    "This chapter presents the binary search tree, which is an efficient\n",
    "implementation of the `Map` interface that is particularly useful if we\n",
    "want to keep the elements sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What's wrong with hashing?\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point you should be familiar with the `Map` interface and the\n",
    "`HashMap` implementation provided by Java. And by making your own `Map`\n",
    "using a hash table, you should understand how `HashMap` works and why we\n",
    "expect its core methods to be constant time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this performance, `HashMap` is widely used, but it is not the\n",
    "only implementation of `Map`. There are a few reasons you might want\n",
    "another implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Hashing can be slow, so even though `HashMap` operations are\n",
    "    constant time, the \"constant\" might be big.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Hashing works well if the hash function distributes the keys evenly\n",
    "    among the sub-maps. But designing good hash functions is not easy,\n",
    "    and if too many keys end up in the same sub-map, the performance of\n",
    "    the `HashMap` may be poor.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  The keys in a hash table are not stored in any particular order; in\n",
    "    fact, the order might change when the table grows and the keys are\n",
    "    rehashed. For some applications, it is necessary, or at least\n",
    "    useful, to keep the keys in order.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is hard to solve all of these problems at the same time, but Java\n",
    "provides an implementation called `TreeMap` that comes close:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  It doesn't use a hash function, so it avoids the cost of hashing and\n",
    "    the difficulty of choosing a hash function.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Inside the `TreeMap`, the keys are are stored in a **binary search\n",
    "    tree**, which makes it possible to traverse the keys, in order, in\n",
    "    linear time.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  The runtime of the core methods is proportional to $\\log n$, which\n",
    "    is not quite as good as constant time, but it is still very good.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next section, I'll explain how binary search trees work and then\n",
    "you will use one to implement a `Map`. Along the way, we'll analyze the\n",
    "performance of the core map methods when implemented using a tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Binary search tree\n",
    "\n",
    "A binary search tree (BST) is a tree where each node contains a key, and\n",
    "every `node` has the \"BST property\":\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  If `node` has a left child, all keys in the left subtree must be\n",
    "    less than the key in `node`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  If `node` has a right child, all keys in the right subtree must be\n",
    "    greater than the key in `node`.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Example of a binary search\n",
    "tree.](figs/Binary_search_tree_1229.png){height=\"2.5in\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "FigureÂ [\\[fig-bst\\]](#fig-bst){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"fig-bst\"}\n",
    "shows a tree of integers that has this property. This figure is from the\n",
    "Wikipedia page on binary search trees at <http://thinkdast.com/bst>,\n",
    "which you might find useful while you work on this exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key in the root is 8, and you can confirm that all keys to the left\n",
    "of the root are less than 8, and all keys to the right are greater. You\n",
    "can also check that the other nodes have this property.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking up a key in a binary search tree is fast because we don't have\n",
    "to search the entire tree. Starting at the root, we can use the\n",
    "following algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Compare the key you are looking for, `target`, to the key in the\n",
    "    current node. If they are equal, you are done.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  If `target` is less than the current key, search the left tree. If\n",
    "    there isn't one, `target` is not in the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  If `target` is greater than the current key, search the right tree.\n",
    "    If there isn't one, `target` is not in the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "At each level of the tree, you only have to search one child. For\n",
    "example, if you look for `target = 4` in the previous diagram, you start\n",
    "at the root, which contains the key `8`. Because `target` is less than\n",
    "`8`, you go left. Because `target` is greater than `3` you go right.\n",
    "Because `target` is less than `6`, you go left. And then you find the\n",
    "key you are looking for.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, it takes four comparisons to find the target, even\n",
    "though the tree contains nine keys. In general, the number of\n",
    "comparisons is proportional to the height of the tree, not the number of\n",
    "keys in the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what can we say about the relationship between the height of the\n",
    "tree, `h`, and the number of nodes, $n$? Starting small and working up:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   If `h=1`, the tree only contains one node, so `n=1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   If `h=2`, we can add two more nodes, for a total of `n=3`.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   If `h=3`, we can add up to four more nodes, for a total of `n=7`.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   If `h=4`, we can add up to eight more nodes, for a total of `n=15`.\n",
    "\n",
    "By now you might see the pattern. If we number the levels of the tree\n",
    "from `1` to `h`, the level with index `i` can have up to $2^{i-1}$\n",
    "nodes. And the total number of nodes in `h` levels is $2^h-1$. If we\n",
    "have\n",
    "\n",
    "$$n = 2^h - 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "we can take the logarithm base 2 of both sides:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$log_2 n \\approx h$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which means that the height of the tree is proportional to $\\log n$, if\n",
    "the tree is full; that is, if each level contains the maximum number of\n",
    "nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we expect that we can look up a key in a binary search tree in time\n",
    "proportional to $\\log n$. This is true if the tree is full, and even if\n",
    "the tree is only partially full. But it is not always true, as we will\n",
    "see.\n",
    "\n",
    "An algorithm that takes time proportional to $\\log n$ is called\n",
    "\"logarithmic\" or \"log time\", and it belongs to the order of growth\n",
