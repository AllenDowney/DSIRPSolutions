    "search term. For rare terms, that might be a small number, but for\n",

    "Inside the loop, we run `getCount`, which finds a `TermCounter` on\n",

    "constant time operations, so the overall complexity of `getCounts` is\n",

    "Using the data structures we designed, how long will it take to index a\n",
    "page? Again, think about your answer before you continue.\n",
    "\n",
    "To index a page, we traverse its DOM tree, find all the `TextNode`\n",

    "\n",
    "For each term, we increment a counter in a HashMap, which is a constant\n",

    "Pushing the `TermCounter` to Redis requires deleting a `TermCounter`,\n",
    "which is linear in the number of unique terms. Then for each term we\n",
    "have to\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Add an element to a `URLSet`, and\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Add an element to a Redis `TermCounter`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these are constant time operations, so the total time to push\n",
    "the `TermCounter` is linear in the number of unique search terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, making the `TermCounter` is proportional to the number of\n",
    "words on the page. Pushing the `TermCounter` to Redis is proportional to\n",
    "the number of unique terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the number of words on the page usually exceeds the number of\n",
    "unique search terms, the overall complexity is proportional to the\n",
    "number of words on the page. In theory a page might contain all search\n",

    "\n",
    "This analysis suggests a way to improve performance: we should probably\n",
    "avoid indexing very common words. First of all, they take up a lot of\n",
    "time and space, because they appear in almost every `URLSet` and\n",
    "`TermCounter`. Furthermore, they are not very useful because they don't\n",
    "help identify relevant pages.\n",
