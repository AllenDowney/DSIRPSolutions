    "\n",
    "This book presents three topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Data structures: Starting with the structures in the Java\n",
    "    Collections Framework (JCF), you will learn how to use data\n",
    "    structures like lists and maps, and you will see how they work.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Analysis of algorithms: I present techniques for analyzing code and\n",
    "    predicting how fast it will run and how much space (memory) it will\n",
    "    require.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Information retrieval: To motivate the first two topics, and to make\n",
    "    the exercises more interesting, we will use data structures and\n",
    "    algorithms to build a simple web search engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an outline of the order of topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   We'll start with the `List` interface and you will write classes\n",
    "    that implement this interface two different ways. Then we'll compare\n",
    "    your implementations with the Java classes `ArrayList` and\n",
    "    `LinkedList`.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Next I'll introduce tree-shaped data structures and you will work on\n",
    "    the first application: a program that reads pages from Wikipedia,\n",
    "    parses the contents, and navigates the resulting tree to find links\n",
    "    and other features. We'll use these tools to test the \"Getting to\n",
    "    Philosophy\" conjecture (you can get a preview by reading\n",
    "    <http://thinkdast.com/getphil>).\n",
    "\n",
    "-   We'll learn about the `Map` interface and Java's `HashMap`\n",
    "    implementation. Then you'll write classes that implement this\n",
    "    interface using a hash table and a binary search tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Finally, you will use these classes (and a few others I'll present\n",
    "    along the way) to implement a web search engine, including: a\n",
    "    crawler that finds and reads pages, an indexer that stores the\n",
    "    contents of Web pages in a form that can be searched efficiently,\n",
    "    and a retriever that takes queries from a user and returns relevant\n",
    "    results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why are there two kinds of `List`?\n",
    "\n",
    "When people start working with the Java Collections Framework, they are\n",
    "sometimes confused about `ArrayList` and `LinkedList`. Why does Java\n",
    "provide two implementations of the `List` `interface`? And how should\n",
    "you choose which one to use? We will answer these questions in the next\n",
    "few chapters.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll start by reviewing `interface`s and the classes that implement\n",
    "them, and I'll present the idea of \"programming to an interface\".\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first few exercises, you'll implement classes similar to\n",
    "`ArrayList` and `LinkedList`, so you'll know how they work, and we'll\n",
    "see that each of them has pros and cons. Some operations are faster or\n",
    "use less space with `ArrayList`; others are faster or smaller with\n",
    "`LinkedList`. Which one is better for a particular application depends\n",
    "on which operations it performs most often.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interfaces in Java\n",
    "\n",
    "A Java `interface` specifies a set of methods; any class that implements\n",
    "this `interface` has to provide these methods. For example, here is the\n",
    "source code for `Comparable`, which is an `interface` defined in the\n",
    "package `java.lang`:"
