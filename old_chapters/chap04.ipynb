    "## Interpreting results\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on our understanding of how `ArrayList` works, we expect the `add`\n",
    "method to take constant time when we add elements to the end. So the\n",
    "total time to add $n$ elements should be linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "To test that theory, we could plot total runtime versus problem size,\n",
    "and we should see a straight line, at least for problem sizes that are\n",
    "big enough to measure accurately. Mathematically, we can write the\n",
    "function for that line:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mbox{runtime}= a + b n$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $a$ is the intercept of the line and $b$ is the slope.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if `add` is linear, the total time for $n$ adds would\n",
    "be quadratic. If we plot runtime versus problem size, we expect to see a\n",
    "parabola. Or mathematically, something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mbox{runtime}= a + b n + c n^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "With perfect data, we might be able to tell the difference between a\n",
    "straight line and a parabola, but if the measurements are noisy, it can\n",
    "be hard to tell. A better way to interpret noisy measurements is to plot\n",
    "runtime and problem size on a **log-log** scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why? Let's suppose that runtime is proportional to $n^k$, but we don't\n",
    "know what the exponent $k$ is. We can write the relationship like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mbox{runtime}= a + b n + \\ldots + c n^k$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For large values of $n$, the term with the largest exponent is the most\n",
    "important, so:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mbox{runtime}\\approx c n^k$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\approx$ means \"approximately equal\". Now, if we take the\n",
    "logarithm of both sides of this equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\log(\\mbox{runtime}) \\approx \\log(c) + k \\log(n)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation implies that if we plot $\\mbox{runtime}$ versus $n$ on a\n",
    "log-log scale, we expect to see a straight line with intercept $\\log(c)$\n",
    "and slope $k$. We don't care much about the intercept, but the slope\n",
    "indicates the order of growth: if $k=1$, the algorithm is linear; if\n",
    "$k=2$, it's quadratic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the figure in the previous section, you can estimate the\n",
    "slope by eye. But when you call `plotResults` it computes a least\n",
    "squares fit to the data and prints the estimated slope. In this example:"
