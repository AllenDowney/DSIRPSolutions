    "## The philosophy behind the book {#the-philosophy-behind-the-book .unnumbered}\n",
    "\n",
    "Data structures and algorithms are among the most important inventions\n",
    "of the last 50 years, and they are fundamental tools software engineers\n",
    "need to know. But in my opinion, most of the books on these topics are\n",
    "too theoretical, too big, and too \"bottom up\":\n",
    "\n",
    "Too theoretical\n",
    "\n",
    ":   Mathematical analysis of algorithms is based on simplifying\n",
    "    assumptions that limit its usefulness in practice. Many\n",
    "    presentations of this topic gloss over the simplifications and focus\n",
    "    on the math. In this book I present the most practical subset of\n",
    "    this material and omit or de-emphasize the rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Too big\n",
    "\n",
    ":   Most books on these topics are at least 500 pages, and some are more\n",
    "    than 1000. By focusing on the topics I think are most useful for\n",
    "    software engineers, I kept this book under 200 pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Too \"bottom up\"\n",
    "\n",
    ":   Many data structures books focus on how data structures work (the\n",
    "    implementations), with less about how to use them (the interfaces).\n",
    "    In this book, I go \"top down\", starting with the interfaces. Readers\n",
    "    learn to use the structures in the Java Collections Framework before\n",
    "    getting into the details of how they work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, some books present this material out of context and without\n",
    "motivation: it's just one damn data structure after another! I try to\n",
    "liven it up by organizing the topics around an application --- web\n",
    "search --- that uses data structures extensively, and is an interesting\n",
    "and important topic in its own right.\n",
    "\n",
    "This application motivates some topics that are not usually covered in\n",
    "an introductory data structures class, including persistent data\n",
    "structures with Redis.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have made difficult decisions about what to leave out, but I have made\n",
    "some compromises. I include a few topics that most readers will never\n",
    "use, but that they might be expected to know, possibly in a technical\n",
    "interview. For these topics, I present both the conventional wisdom as\n",
    "well as my reasons to be skeptical.\n",
    "\n",
    "This book also presents basic aspects of software engineering practice,\n",
    "including version control and unit testing. Most chapters include an\n",
    "exercise that allows readers to apply what they have learned. Each\n",
    "exercise provides automated tests that check the solution. And for most\n",
    "exercises, I present my solution at the beginning of the next chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "This book is intended for college students in computer science and\n",
    "related fields, as well as professional software engineers, people\n",
    "training in software engineering, and people preparing for technical\n",
    "interviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you start this book, you should know Java pretty well; in\n",
    "particular, you should know how to define a new class that extends an\n",
    "existing class or implements an . If your Java is rusty, here are two\n",
    "books you might start with:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Downey and Mayfield, *Think Java* (O'Reilly Media, 2016), which is\n",
    "    intended for people who have never programmed before.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Sierra and Bates, *Head First Java* (O'Reilly Media, 2005), which is\n",
    "    appropriate for people who already know another programming\n",
    "    language.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are not familiar with interfaces in Java, you might want to work\n",
    "through the tutorial called \"What Is an Interface?\" at\n",
    "<http://thinkdast.com/interface>.\n",
    "\n",
    "One vocabulary note: the word \"interface\" can be confusing. In the\n",
    "context of an **application programming interface** (API), it refers to\n",
    "a set of classes and methods that provide certain capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of Java, it also refers to a language feature, similar to\n",
    "a class, that specifies a set of methods. To help avoid confusion, I'll\n",
    "use \"interface\" in the normal typeface for the general idea of an\n",
    "interface, and in the code typeface for the Java language feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should also be familiar with type parameters and generic types. For\n",
    "example, you should know how create an object with a type parameter,\n",
    "like . If not, you can read about type parameters at\n",
    "<http://thinkdast.com/types>.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should be familiar with the Java Collections Framework (JCF), which\n",
    "you can read about at <http://thinkdast.com/collections>. In particular,\n",
    "you should know about the and the classes and .\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally you should be familiar with Apache Ant, which is an automated\n",
    "build tool for Java. You can read more about Ant at\n",
    "<http://thinkdast.com/anttut>.\n",
    "\n",
    "And you should be familiar with `JUnit`, which is a unit testing\n",
    "framework for Java. You can read more about it at\n",
    "<http://thinkdast.com/junit>.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Working with the code {#code .unnumbered}\n",
    "\n",
    "The code for this book is in a Git repository at\n",
    "<http://thinkdast.com/repo>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Git is a \"version control system\" that allows you to keep track of the\n",
    "files that make up a project. A collection of files under Git's control\n",
    "is called a \"repository\".\n",
    "\n",
    "GitHub is a hosting service that provides storage for Git repositories\n",
    "and a convenient web interface. It provides several ways to work with\n",
    "the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   You can create a copy of the repository on GitHub by pressing the\n",
    "    Fork button. If you don't already have a GitHub account, you'll need\n",
    "    to create one. After forking, you'll have your own repository on\n",
    "    GitHub that you can use to keep track of code you write. Then you\n",
    "    can \"clone\" the repository, which downloads a copy of the files to\n",
    "    your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Alternatively, you could clone the repository without forking. If\n",
    "    you choose this option, you don't need a GitHub account, but you\n",
    "    won't be able to save your changes on GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   If you don't want to use Git at all, you can download the code in a\n",
    "    ZIP archive using the Download button on the GitHub page, or this\n",
    "    link: <http://thinkdast.com/zip>.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you clone the repository or unzip the ZIP file, you should have a\n",
    "directory called `ThinkDataStructures` with a subdirectory called\n",
    "`code`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The examples in this book were developed and tested using Java SE\n",
    "Development Kit 7. If you are using an older version, some examples will\n",
    "not work. If you are using a more recent version, they should all work.\n",

    "this material, which provides an online development environment, help\n",
    "from instructors and other students, and a certificate of completion.\n",
