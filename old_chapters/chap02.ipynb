    "# Analysis of Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw in the previous chapter, Java provides two implementations of\n",
    "the `List` interface, `ArrayList` and `LinkedList`. For some\n",
    "applications `LinkedList` is faster; for other applications `ArrayList`\n",
    "is faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "To decide which one is better for a particular application, one approach\n",
    "is to try them both and see how long they take. This approach, which is\n",
    "called \"profiling\", has a few problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Before you can compare the algorithms, you have to implement them\n",
    "    both.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  The results might depend on what kind of computer you use. One\n",
    "    algorithm might be better on one machine; the other might be better\n",
    "    on a different machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  The results might depend on the size of the problem or the data\n",
    "    provided as input.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can address some of these problems using **analysis of algorithms**.\n",
    "When it works, algorithm analysis makes it possible to compare\n",
    "algorithms without having to implement them. But we have to make some\n",
    "assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  To avoid dealing with the details of computer hardware, we usually\n",
    "    identify the basic operations that make up an algorithm --- like\n",
    "    addition, multiplication, and comparison of numbers --- and count\n",
    "    the number of operations each algorithm requires.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  To avoid dealing with the details of the input data, the best option\n",
    "    is to analyze the average performance for the inputs we expect. If\n",
    "    that's not possible, a common alternative is to analyze the worst\n",
    "    case scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Finally, we have to deal with the possibility that one algorithm\n",
    "    works best for small problems and another for big ones. In that\n",
    "    case, we usually focus on the big ones, because for small problems\n",
    "    the difference probably doesn't matter, but for big problems the\n",
    "    difference can be huge.\n",
    "\n",
    "This kind of analysis lends itself to simple classification of\n",
    "algorithms. For example, if we know that the runtime of Algorithm A\n",
    "tends to be proportional to the size of the input, $n$, and Algorithm B\n",
    "tends to be proportional to $n^2$, we expect A to be faster than B, at\n",
    "least for large values of $n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most simple algorithms fall into just a few categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Constant time: An algorithm is \"constant time\" if the runtime does\n",
    "    not depend on the size of the input. For example, if you have an\n",
    "    array of $n$ elements and you use the bracket operator (`[]`) to\n",
    "    access one of the elements, this operation takes the same number of\n",
    "    operations regardless of how big the array is.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Linear: An algorithm is \"linear\" if the runtime is proportional to\n",
    "    the size of the input. For example, if you add up the elements of an\n",
    "    array, you have to access $n$ elements and perform $n-1$ additions.\n",
    "    The total number of operations (element accesses and additions) is\n",
    "    $2n-1$, which is proportional to $n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Quadratic: An algorithm is \"quadratic\" if the runtime is\n",
    "    proportional to $n^2$. For example, suppose you want to check\n",
    "    whether any element in a list appears more than once. A simple\n",
    "    algorithm is to compare each element to all of the others. If there\n",
    "    are $n$ elements and each is compared to $n-1$ others, the total\n",
    "    number of comparisons is $n^2 -n$, which is proportional to $n^2$ as\n",
    "    $n$ grows.\n",
    "\n",

    "The first method, `swapElements`, swaps two elements of the array.\n",
    "Reading and writing elements are constant time operations, because if we\n",
    "know the size of the elements and the location of the first, we can\n",
    "compute the location of any other element with one multiplication and\n",
    "one addition, and those are constant time operations. Since everything\n",
    "in `swapElements` is constant time, the whole method is constant time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second method, `indexLowest`, finds the index of the smallest\n",
    "element of the array starting at a given index, `start`. Each time\n",
    "through the loop, it accesses two elements of the array and performs one\n",
    "comparison. Since these are all constant time operations, it doesn't\n",
    "really matter which ones we count. To keep it simple, let's count the\n",
    "number of comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  If `start` is 0, `indexLowest` traverses the entire array, and the\n",
    "    total number of comparisons is the length of the array, which I'll\n",
    "    call $n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  If `start` is 1, the number of comparisons is $n-1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  In general, the number of comparisons is $n$ - `start`, so\n",
    "    `indexLowest` is linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third method, `selectionSort`, sorts the array. It loops from 0 to\n",
    "$n-1$, so the loop executes $n$ times. Each time, it calls `indexLowest`\n",
    "and then performs a constant time operation, `swapElements`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first time `indexLowest` is called, it performs $n$ comparisons. The\n",
    "second time, it performs $n-1$ comparisons, and so on. The total number\n",
    "of comparisons is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$n + n-1 + n-2 + ... + 1 + 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The sum of this series is $n(n+1)/2$, which is proportional to $n^2$;\n",
    "and that means that `selectionSort` is quadratic.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get to the same result a different way, we can think of `indexLowest`\n",
    "as a nested loop. Each time we call `indexLowest`, the number of\n",
    "operations is proportional to $n$. We call it $n$ times, so the total\n",
    "number of operations is proportional to $n^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Big O notation\n",
    "\n",
    "All constant time algorithms belong to a set called $O(1)$. So another\n",
    "way to say that an algorithm is constant time is to say that it is in\n",
    "$O(1)$. Similarly, all linear algorithms belong to $O(n)$, and all\n",
    "quadratic algorithms belong to $O(n^2)$. This way of classifying\n",
    "algorithms is called \"big O notation\".\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: I am providing a casual definition of big O notation. For a more\n",
    "mathematical treatment, see <http://thinkdast.com/bigo>.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notation provides a convenient way to write general rules about how\n",
    "algorithms behave when we compose them. For example, if you perform a\n",
    "linear time algorithm followed by a constant algorithm, the total run\n",
    "time is linear. Using $\\in$ to mean \"is a member of\":\n",
    "\n",
    "If $f \\in O(n)$ and $g \\in O(1)$, $f+g \\in O(n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you perform two linear operations, the total is still linear:\n",
    "\n",
    "If $f \\in O(n)$ and $g \\in O(n)$, $f+g \\in O(n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, if you perform a linear operation any number of times, $k$, the\n",
    "total is linear, as long as $k$ is a constant that does not depend on\n",
    "$n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If $f \\in O(n)$ and $k$ is a constant, $kf \\in O(n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "But if you perform a linear operation $n$ times, the result is\n",
    "quadratic:\n",
    "\n",
    "If $f \\in O(n)$, $nf \\in O(n^2)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, we only care about the largest exponent of $n$. So if the\n",
    "total number of operations is $2n + 1$, it belongs to $O(n)$. The\n",
    "leading constant, 2, and the additive term, 1, are not important for\n",
    "this kind of analysis. Similarly, $n^2 + 100n + 1000$ is in $O(n^2)$.\n",
    "Don't be distracted by the big numbers!\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Order of growth\" is another name for the same idea. An order of growth\n",
    "is a set of algorithms whose runtimes are in the same big O category;\n",
    "for example, all linear algorithms belong to the same order of growth\n",
    "because their runtimes are in $O(n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this context, an \"order\" is a group, like the *Order of the Knights\n",
    "of the Round Table*, which is a group of knights, not a way of lining\n",
    "them up. So you can imagine the *Order of Linear Algorithms* as a set of\n",
    "brave, chivalrous, and particularly efficient algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 2\n",
    "\n",
    "The exercise for this chapter is to implement a `List` that uses a Java\n",
    "array to store the elements.\n",

    "In the code repository for this book (see\n",
