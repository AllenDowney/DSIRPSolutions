    "\n",
    "In the next few exercises we will get back to building a web search\n",
    "engine. To review, the components of a search engine are:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Crawling: We'll need a program that can download a web page, parse\n",
    "    it, and extract the text and any links to other pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Indexing: We'll need an index that makes it possible to look up a\n",
    "    search term and find the pages that contain it.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Retrieval: And we'll need a way to collect results from the index\n",
    "    and identify pages that are most relevant to the search terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you did Exercise [\\[exercise6\\]](#exercise6){reference-type=\"ref\"\n",
    "reference=\"exercise6\"}, you implemented an index using Java maps. In\n",
    "this exercise, we'll revisit the indexer and make a new version that\n",
    "stores the results in a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you did Exercise [\\[exercise5\\]](#exercise5){reference-type=\"ref\"\n",
    "reference=\"exercise5\"}, you built a crawler that follows the first link\n",
    "it finds. In the next exercise, we'll make a more general version that\n",
    "stores every link it finds in a queue and explores them in order.\n",
    "\n",
    "And then, finally, you will work on the retrieval problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "In these exercises, I provide less starter code, and you will make more\n",
    "design decisions. These exercises are also more open-ended. I will\n",
    "suggest some minimal goals you should try to reach, but there are many\n",
    "ways you can go farther if you want to challenge yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's get started on a new version of the indexer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Redis\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous version of the indexer stores the index in two data\n",
    "structures: a `TermCounter` that maps from a search term to the number\n",
    "of times it appears on a web page, and an `Index` that maps from a\n",
    "search term to the set of pages where it appears.\n",
    "\n",
    "These data structures are stored in the memory of a running Java\n",
    "program, which means that when the program stops running, the index is\n",
    "lost. Data stored only in the memory of a running program is called\n",
    "\"volatile\", because it vaporizes when the program ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data that persists after the program that created it ends is called\n",
    "\"persistent\". In general, files stored in a file system are persistent,\n",
    "as well as data stored in databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple way to make data persistent is to store it in a file. Before\n",
    "the program ends, it could translate its data structures into a format\n",
    "like JSON (<http://thinkdast.com/json>) and then write them into a file.\n",
    "When it starts again, it could read the file and rebuild the data\n",
    "structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "But there are several problems with this solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Reading and writing large data structures (like a Web index) would\n",
    "    be slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  The entire data structure might not fit into the memory of a single\n",
    "    running program.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  If a program ends unexpectedly (for example, due to a power outage),\n",
    "    any changes made since the program last started would be lost.\n",
    "\n",
    "A better alternative is a database that provides persistent storage and\n",
    "the ability to read and write parts of the database without reading and\n",
    "writing the whole thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many kinds of database management systems (DBMS) that provide\n",
    "different capabilities. You can read an overview at\n",
    "<http://thinkdast.com/database>.\n",
    "\n",
    "The database I recommend for this exercise is Redis, which provides\n",
    "persistent data structures that are similar to Java data structures.\n",
    "Specifically, it provides:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Lists of strings, similar to Java `List`.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Hashes, similar to Java `Map`.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Sets of strings, similar to Java `Set`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Redis is a \"key-value database\", which means that the data structures it\n",
    "contains (the values) are identified by unique strings (the keys). A key\n",
    "in Redis plays the same role as a reference in Java: it identifies an\n",
    "object. We'll see some examples soon.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Redis clients and servers\n",
    "\n",
    "Redis is usually run as a remote service; in fact, the name stands for\n",
    "\"REmote DIctionary Server\". To use Redis, you have to run the Redis\n",
    "server somewhere and then connect to it using a Redis client. There are\n",
    "many ways to set up a server and many clients you could use. For this\n",
    "exercise, I recommend:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Rather than install and run the server yourself, consider using a\n",
    "    service like RedisToGo (<http://thinkdast.com/redistogo>), which\n",
    "    runs Redis in the cloud. They offer a free plan with enough\n",
    "    resources for the exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  For the client I recommend Jedis, which is a Java library that\n",
    "    provides classes and methods for working with Redis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are more detailed instructions to help you get started:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Create an account on RedisToGo, at <http://thinkdast.com/redissign>,\n",
    "    and select the plan you want (probably the free plan to get\n",
    "    started).\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Create an \"instance\", which is a virtual machine running the Redis\n",
    "    server. If you click on the \"Instances\" tab, you should see your new\n",
    "    instance, identified by a host name and a port number. For example,\n",
    "    I have an instance named \"dory-10534\".\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Click on the instance name to get the configuration page. Make a\n",
    "    note of the URL near the top of the page, which looks like this:"
