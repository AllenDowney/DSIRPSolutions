    "    contain \"indonesia\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Expressions like these that contain search terms and operators are\n",
    "called \"queries\".\n",
    "\n",
    "When applied to search results, the boolean operators `AND`, `OR`, and\n",
    "`-` correspond to the set operations `intersection`, `union`, and\n",
    "`difference`. For example, suppose\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `s1` is the set of pages containing \"java\",\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `s2` is the set of pages containing \"programming\", and\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `s3` is the set of pages containing \"indonesia\".\n",
    "\n",
    "In that case:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The intersection of `s1` and `s2` is the set of pages containing\n",
    "    \"java\" AND \"programming\".\n",

    "-   The union of `s1` and `s2` is the set of pages containing \"java\" OR\n",
    "    \"programming\".\n",
